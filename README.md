## this is your hub for all things **_zucc_** **( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)**
- you will play as congress and land hits on various moving zuccs
- as you shoot glasses of water, you'll be met with thoughts and prayers. these are very effective, and *will* do damage.
- the game ends when you die or when you are victorious over all of the zuccs

***

### instructions
- shoot the zuccs. each zucc has a different health level, your score will increase accordingly
- dodge the thoughts and prayers
- look out for an orange man. you may be able to earn yourself some extra points! :^)
- you can take 3 hits from thoughts and prayers before it's _game over_
